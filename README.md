# Project title
YourLeague

### What and why?
The system would be where one can able to create a "league" and then could add teams and it would be a way for people to organize the way they are playing basketball, or any other competitive activity, along with keeping track of individual statisitcs.
This is necessary as often times I along with my friends compete in sports games and other competitions but we never have a simple way to keep track of the standings, our own statistics, or organize a playoff/tournament bracket. This would allow people to organize the way they compete.

### For whom?
This software will be for anyone who wants to organize the way they compete. Whether it is an entire league of pickup basketball, or a tournament of who can code a Connect-4 game the fastest. This software will allow anyone who seeks to compete be organized in how they compete.

### How?
The user will either be a "commisioner", "team admin" or a regular user. 

The "commisioner" will be able to create a "league". They can then specify how many teams are in the league, how many players can be on each team. They can choose if there is a playoff for a championship, how many teams make that playoff. They can create a schedule manually or by random, or they can have no schedule and just update the standings of their "league". All of this will be connect via a database.

Each "team admin" will be the head of their team, and will be able to change the team logo and team name. They also will be the one in charge of adding people to their team along with updating their statistics via forms which will connect to the database. The commsioner will be able to edit this as well as they will be the "master admin".

The regular user will have a dashboard of their leagues they are in and will be able to view the "league" they are in, the standings, statistics, etc. 

### Scope
This proposal is perfectly balanced for a group project as there are several different components and user types to make this idea work. This would make it very easy to divide the work among 4-6 people.
